# Statistics_for_DataScience

in folder "Statitics for Data Science", I will try to explain and share all core concepts of Statistics required to know as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst.

> Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data (https://www.stat.uci.edu/what-is-statistics/).

in simple word, we can say that statistics is a technique to acquire data, understand data, display or visualize data and at the end take a conclusion from the data itself. Statistics is widely used in many disciplines such as marketing, business, healthcare, telecommunication, etc. All Statistics terminologies related to Data Science will be explain using Python Code.

Thank you.
