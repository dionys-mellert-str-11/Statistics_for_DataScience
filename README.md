# Statistics_for_DataScience

in folder "Statitics for Data Science", I will try to explain and share all core concepts of Statistics required to know as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst.

## Terminology
> Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data (https://www.stat.uci.edu/what-is-statistics/).

in simple word, we can say that statistics is a technique to acquire, understand, display or visualize and at the end take a conclusion from that data. Statistics is widely used in many disciplines such as marketing, business, healthcare, telecommunication, etc.
